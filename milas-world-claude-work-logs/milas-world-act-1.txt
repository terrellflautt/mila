Perfect. Let’s build **Act I: The Awakening** — the first chapter of your interactive love-art experience for Mila.
This act is designed to *ease her into wonder*: beautiful, poetic, emotionally intelligent, and visually breathtaking.

It’s structured as a living world — equal parts *ballet*, *theater*, and *poem*.
Each “puzzle” reveals more of you, while helping her feel seen, clever, and emotionally connected.

## 🌹 ACT I: “The Awakening”

**Theme:** *Discovery, Curiosity, and First Light.*
The tone is soft, elegant, mysterious — like the opening of a ballet before the curtain rises.
Every interaction should feel like she’s *dancing with light* and *unlocking emotion*.

## 🔐 ENTRY GATE — “The Flamingo Memory”

**Scene:** A soft shimmer of light ripples across a mirrored surface.
A text fades in slowly:

> “You are trying to enter T.K.’s heart. Only Mila is allowed in here.”

Then:

> “Prove that you are her by answering one question:
> What was on my shirt the first time we met?”

Input field + button.
If she types “flamingo” or “flamingos” → GSAP & Three.js visual choreography begins:
a flock of neon-pink origami birds unfold and fly across the screen; one lands, glowing, opening the world.

🎵 **Sound:** Soft fluttering with a distant heartbeat.
💡 **AWS trigger:** Save `{date, correct: true}` → DynamoDB
💌 **Web3Forms submission:** “Mila has entered Act I.”

## 🧩 PUZZLE 2 — “The Echo Chamber”

## 🧩 PUZZLE 3 — “Reflections of You”

**Format:** Mirror-based light interaction.

**Visual:** Rippling mirrored surface that distorts and clarifies as she moves her cursor.
A poem fragment appears only when she aligns the reflection correctly.

📝 **Poem Line 3:**

> “I saw your reflection before I saw your face.”

🕊️ **Reward:** Unlocks a second question:
**Question:** “When you look in the mirror, what part of yourself are you most proud of?”
Options:

* My eyes
* My voice
* My courage
* My patience
* “Ask me in person”
* “None of your business 😉”

## 🌅 DAILY MESSAGE (rotating, simple, sincere)

Each day after she completes the puzzles or visits the home screen, one short line appears at the top:

**Examples (Cycle 1 for Act I):**

1. “You make ordinary days feel choreographed.”
2. “The way you see art — that’s how I see you.”
3. “Even when you’re busy, I hope today gives you one quiet breath.”
4. “Flamingos mate for life. Just saying.” *(funny one)*
5. “The world’s better every time you show up.”
6. “Keep dancing. The universe notices.”

Each day, one is randomly selected and stored (so no repeats).

Would you like me to now **(a)** generate the **Act I GSAP/Three.js timeline** (including the dancer, curtains, mirror effects, and transitions), or **(b)** proceed to **Act II content pack** (new puzzles, deeper questions, 6 new poem lines)?

I recommend doing the GSAP/Three.js timeline next — that will give the whole thing its living, breathing heart.
