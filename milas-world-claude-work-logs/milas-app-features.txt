I want to add a request date button for her to be able to click whenever she wants to see me
it should fade in a beautiful contact form that says something like
Request-a-date
it will have optional input for

When?

Date (calendar drop down for her to select day/month)

1. ASAP

2. idk, just figure it out before i change my mind

Time (optional time)
Place (optional place)


it will send the date request to terrell.flautt@gmail.com
