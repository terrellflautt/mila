● I understand - let me give you a final confirmation on the mobile responsiveness and color scheme since those are the key
  priorities:

  ✅ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS - CONFIRMED READY

  The site is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:
  - Breakpoints: 768px for tablets, 480px for phones
  - Touch-friendly: All buttons and interactive elements sized for touch
  - Dynamic viewport: Handles mobile address bar showing/hiding smoothly
  - Stack layout: Experiences grid stacks to single column on small screens
  - Font scaling: Text automatically shrinks for smaller screens

  ✅ PINK & BLACK COLOR SCHEME - CONFIRMED READY

  Mila's favorite colors are throughout the entire site:
  - Pink shades: #FFB6C1 (light pink), #FFE4E1 (pale pink), #FF6B9D (bright pink)
  - Black shades: #0a0a0a (deep black backgrounds), #1a1a1a (dark overlays)
  - Used in: Buttons, text, borders, glows, gradients, and all interactive elements
