## ⚠️ OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS AVAILABLE

These are **NOT required** for launch but were in the original vision:

### 1. **Extended Question System** (Optional)
**Original Plan:** 25+ progressive questions (easy → intimate) with:
- Multiple choice options
- "Ask me in person" option
- "None of your business" option
- Show your answer after she answers
- 1-3 questions per day
- DynamoDB storage

**Current State:** Date request form only

**Recommendation:** The current date request is perfect for its purpose. If you want the question system, I can build it, but it's not essential.

### 2. **18 Original Poem Lines** (Optional)
**Original Plan:** 18 specific lines inspired by Maya Angelou to reveal across puzzles

**Current State:** 31 daily messages serve a similar purpose

**Recommendation:** The daily messages are excellent. Poem lines could be added to individual puzzle rewards if desired.

### 3. **DynamoDB Storage** (Optional)
**Original Plan:** Store all answers in DynamoDB

**Current State:** Client-side localStorage only

**Recommendation:** Not needed unless you want cross-device sync. Current approach is simpler and more private.
