## MCP Server Architecture - Designed

### Purpose
Local MCP server for managing Mila's eternal garden with growth stages, genetics, seasons, and AI assistance.

### Core Resources
1. **Plant** - Individual plants with genetics, growth stage, health, water level
2. **Garden** - Overall garden state, season, resources, achievements
3. **Memory** - Moments and milestones in the garden
4. **Seed** - Plantable items with genetic information

### MCP Tools
**Garden Management:**
- `plant_seed(species, position, genetics?)`
- `water_plant(plantId, amount)`
- `fertilize_plant(plantId)`
- `harvest_plant(plantId)`
- `cross_breed(parent1Id, parent2Id)`

**Garden State:**
- `get_garden_status()`
- `get_plant(plantId)`
- `list_plants(filter?)`
- `advance_time(days)`
- `change_season(season)`

**Genetics & Breeding:**
- `analyze_genetics(plantId)`
- `predict_offspring(parent1Id, parent2Id)`
- `discover_variant()`
- `save_cultivar(plantId, name)`

**Memories & Achievements:**
- `record_memory(type, description, plantId?)`
- `get_memories(dateRange?, type?)`
- `check_achievements()`
- `unlock_achievement(achievementId)`

**AI Garden Assistant:**
- `suggest_planting()`
- `diagnose_plant(plantId)`
- `design_layout(preferences)`
- `generate_plant_description(plantId)`

### MCP Prompts
1. **Garden Curator** - Helps understand current state, suggests next steps
2. **Botanist** - Explains genetics, helps plan breeding
3. **Memory Keeper** - Creates beautiful memories from events
4. **Seasonal Guide** - Guides through seasons, suggests activities

### Growth Algorithm
```
Growth Rate = Base (0.5) √ó Season Modifier √ó Water Modifier √ó Health Modifier
Stages: seed ‚Üí sprout ‚Üí small ‚Üí medium ‚Üí mature (each takes ~2 days base)
Water depletes 20% per day
```

### Genetics System
- Mendelian inheritance with dominant/recessive alleles
- Traits: color, bloom size, height, bloom pattern, fragrance
- 5% beneficial mutation chance on cross-breeding
- Punnett square predictions

### Seasonal Cycle
- 4 seasons: spring/summer/fall/winter
- 5 real-world days per season
- Auto-advance with seasonal events
- Growth modifiers: spring 1.2x, summer 1.0x, fall 0.8x, winter 0.6x

### Achievement Examples
- First Bloom - Witness first flower bloom
- Geneticist - Successfully cross-breed two plants
- Full Cycle - Experience all four seasons
- Rare Discovery - Discover rare genetic variant
- Garden Keeper - Maintain garden for 30 days

### Storage Strategy
**Phase 1 (Local):**
- localStorage for all state
- No backend required
- Offline-first

**Phase 2 (Cloud Optional):**
- AWS Lambda functions for:
  - AI plant generation
  - Complex genetic analysis
  - Community cultivar sharing
  - Cloud sync

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1:** Core MCP server with localStorage (local dev)
2. **Phase 2:** Genetics & breeding system
3. **Phase 3:** Seasonal cycles
4. **Phase 4:** AWS Lambda integration
5. **Phase 5:** Three.js React integration

**Status:** üìê Designed - Ready for implementation

## Key Design Philosophy - "Less Is More"

Throughout today's session, the core theme was **simplicity and genuineness**:

1. **Messages** - Short, direct, powerful. No flowery language.
2. **UI** - Minimal instructions. Trust the user.
3. **Visuals** - Subtle effects, not overwhelming.
4. **Mechanics** - Deep but discoverable, not hand-holding.

### Examples:
- ‚ùå "In the vastness of space, countless stars‚Äîbut when I connect the dots, I only see you."
- ‚úÖ "Among infinite stars, I only see you."

- ‚ùå "Tap stars in sequence - lines will form as you connect them"
- ‚úÖ "Find the patterns in the sky"

- ‚ùå "In gardens, time moves differently..."
- ‚úÖ "Time moves slower in the garden."

**Result:** More impactful, more genuine, more Mila.

## What Makes This Special

Every change today focused on making the experience **feel real and genuine** rather than theatrical or forced. The goal is for Mila to **experience** the love, not be **told** about it.

### The Difference:
**Telling:** "In a universe of infinite possibilities, you were the constellation I was meant to find."
**Showing:** "Every pattern. Every path. You."

The second is more powerful because it trusts her to feel the meaning without over-explaining it.

---

## Ready for Next Session

‚úÖ Constellation experience polished and deployed
‚úÖ MCP server fully designed
‚úÖ Garden mechanics researched and planned
‚úÖ Message philosophy established (less is more)

**Next:** Implement MCP server and enhance eternal garden mechanics.
